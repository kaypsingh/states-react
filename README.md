This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<b>State is a global object which is used to change UI of your web components. Only when state is update DOM is updated. You can't change state object directly, so we use setState function which changes the state and refreshes the DOM.<b>
